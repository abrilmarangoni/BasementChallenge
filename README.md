# Basement — Frontend Dev Challenge

This project was built as part of a 2-day frontend challenge for Basement.

The goal was to replicate a provided Figma design for an e-commerce landing page, focusing on UI accuracy, interactions, performance, and overall polish.
Any missing details were handled using common sense, as suggested in the brief.
